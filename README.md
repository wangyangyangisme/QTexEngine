# QTexEngine
QTeXEngine enables Qt based applications to export graphics to TeX. It is built on top of QPaintEngine and uses the TikZ/Pgf graphic systems for TeX. QTeXEngine can generate TeX code using either Pgf or TikZ syntax. TikZ syntax is the default mode since the ouput files are more compact and easier to read. QTeXEngine can be used on any platform supported by Qt.
